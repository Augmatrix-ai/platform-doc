# MLOps

MLOps is a streamline process of the Model training and Model Deployment. From entire MLOps product you can experience the end-to-end feel of training of model, model analytics, model deployment, model monitoring, model testing can be expected from the MLOps product and also what ever the model end-points can be used in Workflow to automate the use case with the model end-point\
A. **Model Training:**\
It is Two-Step Journey Model Training on the Augmatrix platform is a user-friendly experience divided into two categories:

1\. Base Model Training:\
a. Users can easily select and train their desired model, guided by comprehensive documentation and utilizing allocated credits.

b. Prior to initiating the training process, users can also test the model within the platform itself.



2\.  **Fine-Tuning of Trained Model:**\
a. For models that have already undergone training, the Augmatrix platform supports a fine-tuning process. This allows users to further refine and optimize their trained models for enhanced performance.\
\




This structured approach to Model Training on Augmatrix ensures user comprehension, offering a seamless journey from model selection to advanced fine-tuning.

B. **Model Deployment**

Deploying a machine learning model is a crucial step in making it accessible and usable. Augmatrix platform provides a user-friendly and highly secure environment for model deployment. In this process, dedicated infrastructure is created to safeguard the user's model data.\
User-Friendly Deployment Options:

1. Cluster Configuration:\
   User-Managed Cluster: Allows users to configure their own computational resources.
2. Computation Type: Users can choose between CPU or GPU for their computational needs.
3. Computation Size Selection: Dynamically select the computational size based on usage, ensuring a secure connection between the user's model and infrastructure.
4. POD Size Selection: Provides flexibility with a range of pod sizes to fit seamlessly into the existing infrastructure.
5. Scalability Options:
   1. CPU-Based Scalability: Automatically scales based on pod usage when the CPU limit is reached, ensuring optimal performance.
   2. Request-Based Scalability: Scales based on the number of incoming requests to the endpoint, ensuring responsiveness during high-demand periods.
6. Endpoint Selection:
   1. Private Endpoint: Offers enhanced security by limiting access to the endpoint within the platform.
   2. Public Endpoint: Balances security with accessibility, allowing both platform and external access.



**Deployment Process Summary:** \
The deployment process concludes with the assignment of an endpoint. This endpoint is then seamlessly integrated into the workflow, facilitating the processing of data based on the chosen model. This user-centric approach ensures that the deployment is not only secure but also adaptable to varying computational and scalability needs.
