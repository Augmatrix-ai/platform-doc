# Annotation

### Enhancing Model Performance with Annotation Studio:

During model training, datasets often require annotations to effectively train models. Augmatrix introduces the Annotation Store, a centralized hub for storing and managing annotations, and Annotation studio for data labelling.  Whether it's image annotation, text annotation, or any other labelled data, the Annotation Store streamlines this process.

#### Annotation Flow in Pipelines: Tailoring Annotations for Specific Tasks

The annotation process seamlessly integrates into task-based workflows or model training processes. We support different types of data labelling

* Classification
* Ranking
* Recognition
* Detection/Segmentation etc

Not only these we support combination of all the categories&#x20;

This ensures that annotations are specifically tailored to the unique requirements of each task.
