# Annotation

Enhancing Model Training with Labeled Data In the realm of Model Training, datasets often require annotations to effectively train models. The Augmatrix platform introduces an Annotation Store, serving as a centralized hub where these annotations are stored and managed. Whether it's image annotation, text annotation, or any other labeled data, the Annotation Store streamlines this process.

Annotation Flow in Pipelines: Tailoring Annotations for Specific Tasks The annotation process seamlessly integrates into task based Workflows or Model Training process currently weâ€™re supporting these pipelines in future we will get the other Annotation pipelines

1. Text-classification Pipeline Annotation
2. Object-detection Pipeline Annotation
3. Text-Generation Pipeline Annotation



This ensures that annotations are specifically tailored to the unique requirements of each task.\
