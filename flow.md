# Flow

Flow-page is a canvas where you can build the workflows connecting the blocks of various functions.

You can see the block details and itâ€™s functionality.

1. &#x20;Input: In this block you can configure the Input data to process and see the segmentations and data cleaning happens here after running the input block you can see the output of the individual block.
2. OCR: OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. It is a technology that is used to convert scanned images or handwritten documents into editable and searchable text files. OCR software analyzes the shape and pattern of the characters in the scanned image and translates them into digital text that can be edited and processed on a computer. This technology is widely used in various industries, such as publishing, banking, government, and healthcare, to digitize paper-based documents and streamline document management processes.
3. Annotation: In this block you can see Annotation is the process of adding extra information, notes, or comments to a document, image, or data set to provide additional context and clarity. Annotations are used to highlight key points, provide explanations, or identify specific features of a document or data set.
4. Alignment: Alignment refers to the arrangement of elements in a document so that they are visually and structurally balanced. It is an important principle in graphic design, typography, and document formatting, as it helps to create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing layout that is easy to read and understand.
5. Document classify: In this block the process of assigning categories or classes to documents to make them easier to manage, search, filter, or analyze. A document in this case is an item of information that has content related to some specific category. Product photos, commentaries, invoices, document scans, and emails all can be considered documents. Document classification may be a part of a broader initiative called intelligent document processing
6. Rotate: Rotate refers to the action of turning an object or image around its axis or centre point. In the context of digital media, rotation is a common editing tool that is used to adjust the orientation of an image or video clip.&#x20;
7. Filter: In the context of technology, a filter is commonly used to remove or reduce noise or unwanted data from a digital signal, such as an image or audio file. For example, a photo editing software might have filters that allow you to adjust the brightness, contrast, or saturation of an image
8. Table Extractor: A table extractor is a tool or software application that automatically identifies and extracts data from tables within a document or webpage. The tool uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to recognize the structure of a table and extract the data in a structured format.
9. Table Normalizer: This block on the flow page that helps to standardize tabular data extracted from documents. It allows you to transform tables with inconsistent formatting and structure into a standardized format for further processing. The block also enables you to set rules and conditions to normalize data, such as data type, data format, and data range, making it easier to analyze and manage the data.
10. OCR PDF: OCR PDF refers to a PDF document that has been processed using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to recognize the text in the document and convert it into machine-readable text.
11. Constant: a constant refers to a fixed value that is not updated during the training process. Constants are often used as inputs to a neural network, and they remain the same throughout the training process.
12. Split PDF: Splitting a PDF refers to the process of dividing a single PDF document into multiple smaller PDF documents. This can be useful when you want to extract specific pages from a larger document, or when you want to separate different sections of a document into separate files.
13. Output: Output refers to the result or outcome produced by a process or system. It is the information or data that is generated by a computer program, machine, or other device in response to input or commands

These are main components are provided in the flow-page

There are 4 types of menus you can use

1. Workspace
2. Component menu
3. Component store
4. Editor menu\


Components explanation:

1. Workspace: here you can drag and drop the components from the component menu and configure the inputs by using the editor menu you can save and start the process to extract the documents or statements

Above picture is a sample of workspace without any components

2. Component Menu

Here you can see the components to build the blocks you can drag and drop the components to workspace and configure there

3. Component store: here you can download the components to component menu or else you download the components to augmatrix.io as permanent components
4. Editor menu: Here you can do the changes in the workspace as per requirement



1. save: after creating the component, you can save the block for further modification or further process
2. Run All: Run all function makes works easier after configuring the block properties and Inputs, You can use the Run All function to start the block one-by-one without human interruption.
3. RUN: Run function allows you to do the same function to run the block but here you have to run individually block by block
4. Stop function: The Stop function is a feature that is commonly used to interrupt a process or task that is currently running in a computer application or system. It is used to halt or cancel the current operation or task.
5. UNDO function: the Undo function, the application will undo the last action that was taken by the user. This can be useful if you have made a mistake or if you change your mind and want to reverse a change that was made in the application.
6. Redo: in the Redo function, the application will repeat the last action that was undone by the Undo function. This can be useful if you have undone an action by mistake or if you change your mind and want to reapply a previously undone action. In many applications, the Redo function is accessed through a toolbar or menu, and can be performed using a keyboard shortcut, mouse or touchpad gesture, or by clicking on an icon or button.
7. Lock: Lock function button help to lock the block components in the flow to restrict the moments in the workspace, and you can unlock to move the block components in the flow.
8. ZOOM IN: The Zoom In function is a feature of many computer applications, including web browsers, image editors, and document viewers, that allows the user to increase the size of the displayed content. When you zoom in, the content of the application is displayed at a larger size, allowing you to focus on specific details of the content. This can be useful when you want to read small text, view small images, or see details in a larger image.
9. Fit: The Fit function is a feature of many computer applications, including document viewers and image editors, that allows the user to adjust the displayed content to fit within the visible area of the screen or window.
10. ZOOM out: The Zoom Out function is a feature of many computer applications, including web browsers, image editors, and document viewers, that allows the user to reduce the size of the displayed content. When you zoom out, the content of the application is displayed at a smaller size, allowing you to see more of the content on the screen at once. This can be useful when you want to get an overview of a large document or image, or when you want to see multiple items on the screen at once.
11. DEPLOY: deploy button helps to deploy the flow to the marketplace without any data leakage. This will help others to understand the flow and usage, and it will increase your popularity and reduce the other non-technical developer effort.
12. Console: A console is a text-based interface that allows a user to interact with a computer system or software application through a command line interface (CLI). It provides a way to input commands and receive text-based output in response.

These are the main components of the FLOW PAGE and PROJECT VIEW
